It's a new network for single image dehazing, named Deep DehazeNET. Here is code.

There are four three folders, results, dehazing codes, refinement codes. 

For the dehazing network, run python main.py for training; run python main_test.py for testing.

For the refinement network, run python main.py for training; run python main_test.py for testing. BTW, model in the checkponint folder.
